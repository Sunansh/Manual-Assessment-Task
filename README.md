# Incubyte Manual Test Cases

This repository contains manual test cases for testing the email composing and sending functionality of Gmail, written in both Traditional and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) styles.

## File Contents

- `Incubyte Manual Assessment.xlsx`:
    - **Traditional Style Test Cases**: A detailed list of manual test cases using the traditional approach, describing the test requirements, steps, data, and expected results.
    - **BDD-Style Test Cases**: The same test cases formatted according to BDD syntax, using "Given-When-Then" language to describe user interactions and expected outcomes.

### Sheet 1: Traditional Style Test Cases
The traditional test cases sheet provides a comprehensive description of each test case. The columns in this sheet include:
- **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for each test.
- **Test Case Requirement**: A brief description of the feature or scenario under test.
- **Test Case Description**: A more detailed explanation of what the test covers.
- **Test Steps**: The specific steps needed to perform the test manually.
- **Test Data**: Data inputs required to execute the test.
- **Expected Result**: The result expected after performing the steps with the provided data.
- **Classification**: Indicates whether the test is expected to yield a positive or negative result.

### Sheet 2: BDD-Style Test Cases
The BDD-style sheet outlines the same tests using the Behavior-Driven Development format. Each test case follows a structure of:
- **Given**: The initial conditions or setup.
- **When**: The action that triggers the test.
- **Then**: The expected result or behavior after the action is performed.
- **Classification**: Specifies whether the result is expected to be positive or negative.
